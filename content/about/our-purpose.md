# Our Purpose

Our motto is a very interesting question that plagues humanity, from 
the beginning of time, until this very day…

“What if x did y straight out of our dreams?”

Think about it. There are Disney dreams had, every time you’re sad, 
sing happily with a crowd or fight your enemy. And there are Final 
Fantasy dreams had, when meeting a unique monster, animal or person, 
or whenever something goes majorly wrong with the world. And there 
are comedy dreams happening, every time, everywhere!!!!!

At Urie W, we strive to give you new dream experiences, fresh from 
the dream as possible, even if it might take a little “nerfing,” and 
we aren’t afraid to say hello or goodbye to any of them, either. As 
a good mind should be like water around grounded ideas, so should 
our products be to copyright. If we managed to fail your 
expectations, we’ll try to side with you, as much as we can, as 
possible.

If all of that sounds right with you, then please feel free to use 
our products. We hope you will find them to be just as fun as we did 
when we made them!!!!!

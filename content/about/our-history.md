# Our History

Our company was founded in 2023 by a USA-born African-American man, 
named Urie Wilson. We wouldn’t have actually existed without his 
help in bringing us into our personified being.

## The Creator

Urie Wilson was born into a troubled world, in a generation that 
has its own villains in its own communities and is now rare, in 
Chicago, Illinois, on May 17th. His home in the United States was 
under attack by the devil and a few monsters, until after plenty of 
kooky events, a messiah stopped them, saved his family and gave him 
an offer that he couldn’t refuse.

Urie was known for trying to make sense out of things, being chill, 
loving comedy, games, books and music and getting creative with his 
mind, as well as showing very high reform rates when in trouble. 
His favorite study is about dreams, as which he thinks, have the 
rarest, but highest impact in the media, if used very well...

As the devil’s attacks became even more menacing, more of Urie’s 
family members received the same offer, but the family was losing 
members to it, celebs, monsters, political and criminal forces, but 
as he was abused by such and the family even further, he had 
dreams…

After 28 years, and a lot of file juggling, Urie began spotting 
many of his friends and enemies being struck down dead in stories 
on the news in a pattern seeming like a higher force was getting 
revenge on them and later him, in a certain order, so he 
recollected history of the higher force who probably carried the 
revenge out helping him, and thought of a plan, a Big Bertha, if 
you will, in case he goes down at last, with all of his knowledge, 
experience and dreams included.

So, Urie created a lot of projects, which included several book 
series on sale, several websites, several animations, several 
music tracks and several games, all in production and carried 
from script to script, all from his dreams, which he mastered so 
much knowledge of, by the core concept of dreams, and his 
experience traveling through them and the real world, in order to 
start a redemption plan so big, that higher power would forgive 
him.

Then, Urie founded our company in 2023, with the release of ‘Cori 
and the Hidden World’ on Amazon.

His company’s question….what if x did y, straight out of your 
dreams?
